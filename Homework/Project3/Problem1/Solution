For the problem 1, we need to use the SpakrSQL query the transcation data set.
I mainly used the SparkSQL table and query table method to conduct our tasks.
SparkSQL is a very powerful tool. Through transforming the file to table frame, we can simply use the SQL command do any query, its very
effective and convincence.
