This file including two solution.

In the problem 2, we need to calculate the relative density of supercell and its neighbors average density.

In order to get the result. The firstt step is to calculate all cells' density. 

The second step is to map the density result to a structure that (ID, (slef density, neighbor density/neighbor size))
And with the reducer, we can get the all information about the self_density and neighbor_avg_density for each specific cell.

Then by using the sortby function, I sorted the cells with their self_density, and output the 100 cells which have the highest density.
