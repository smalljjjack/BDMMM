This file including two solution.

In the problem 2, we need to calculate the relative density of supercell and its neighbors average density.

In order to get the result. The firstt step is to calculate all cells' density. 

The second step is to map the density result to a structure that (ID, (slef density, neighbor density/neighbor size))
And with the reduce
